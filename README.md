## 🧠 State Management (Riverpod)

The filter selection and transaction list are managed via `StateProvider` and `Provider`.

- `transaction_provider.dart`: Handles selected filter and provides filtered transaction list.
- UI widgets subscribe to providers using `HookConsumerWidget`.

---

## 💡 Animation

- A `FadeTransition` is applied to the transaction list when the filter changes to create a smooth UI update.

---

## 🖥️ Responsive Layout

- Uses `LayoutBuilder` and `Wrap` widgets for dynamic layout handling.
- Scales properly on both mobile and desktop screens.

---
